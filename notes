# Commands for CPU info:
1. **`nproc`**: This command shows the number of processing units (cores) available to your system.
   ```bash
   nproc
   ```
2. **`lscpu`**: This provides detailed information about your CPU architecture, including the number of cores.
   ```bash
   lscpu | grep "^CPU(s):"
   ```
   The output will show you the number of CPUs/cores available.
3. **`cat /proc/cpuinfo`**: This command lists detailed information about each CPU core. To count the number of cores, you can use:
   ```bash
   grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo
   ```
